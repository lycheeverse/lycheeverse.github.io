description: Check email addresses with lychee and troubleshoot common verification issues.
---

Email address checking is disabled by default. Enable it with the `--include-mail` flag:

```bash
lychee --include-mail .
```

## How It Works

lychee uses [check-if-email-exists](https://github.com/reacherhq/check-if-email-exists) for email validation.

Test an email address with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  'https://api.reacher.email/v0/check_email' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'authorization: test_api_token' \
  -d '{"to_email": "box@domain.test"}'
```

## Verification Issues

Mail server settings can prevent verification:

- SPF Policy restrictions
- DNSBL (DNS-based blocklists)
- SMTP configuration
- Firewall rules

## Excluding Problematic Addresses

If valid emails fail verification, exclude specific addresses:

```bash
lychee --include-mail --exclude 'box@domain\.test' .
```

Or skip email checking entirely by removing the `--include-mail` flag.

## Configuration File

```toml title="lychee.toml"
include_mail = true
exclude = ['box@domain\.test']
```
