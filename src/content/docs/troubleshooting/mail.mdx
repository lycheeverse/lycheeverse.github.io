title: Mail Addresses
---

You can check email addresses by providing the `--include-mail` flag.
We use https://github.com/reacherhq/check-if-email-exists for email checking.
You can test your mail address with curl:

```bash
 curl -X POST \
  'https://api.reacher.email/v0/check_email' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'authorization: test_api_token' \
  -d '{"to_email": "box@domain.test"}'
```

Some settings on your mail server (such as `SPF` Policy, `DNSBL`) may prevent
your email from being verified. If you have an error with checking a working
email, you can exclude specific addresses with the `--exclude` flag or skip
all email addresses by removing the `--include-mail` flag.
