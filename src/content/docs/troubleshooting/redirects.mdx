title: Too Many Redirects
description: Diagnose and resolve redirect loop errors when checking links.
---

Redirect errors occur when a server sends too many redirect responses in a chain:

```bash
Failed: Too many redirects: error following redirect for url
```

## Diagnosing the Issue

Enable verbose logging to see the redirect chain:

```bash
echo 'https://example.com' | lychee -vvv -
```

Example output:

```bash
[DEBUG] Redirecting to https://example.com/foo
[DEBUG] Redirecting to https://example.com/bar
[DEBUG] Redirecting to https://example.com/baz
âœ— [ERR] https://example.com | Failed: Too many redirects
```

Open the URLs in a browser to verify if the redirect chain is legitimate.

## Increasing Redirect Limit

If the redirect chain is valid but long, increase the maximum redirects:

```bash
lychee --max-redirects 10 https://example.com
```

Default is 5 redirects.

## Bot Protection

Servers may redirect bots to CAPTCHA pages, causing redirect loops.

### Change User Agent

Try a popular user agent:

```bash
lychee --user-agent "curl/8.4.0" https://example.com
```

### Network Changes

- Test from a different IP address
- Use a VPN
- Try from a different network

## Whitelisting lychee

Contact the server administrator to whitelist lychee's default user agent if the site is under your control.

## Configuration File

```toml title="lychee.toml"
max_redirects = 10
user_agent = "curl/8.4.0"
```
