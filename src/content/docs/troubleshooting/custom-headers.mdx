title: Custom Headers
---

Some sites expect one or more custom headers to return a valid response.
For example, crates.io expects a `Accept: text/html` header or else it
will [return a 404](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/788).

To fix that you can pass additional headers like so: `--header "accept=text/html"`.
You can use that argument multiple times to add more headers.
Or, you can accept all content/MIME types: `--header "accept=*/*"`.

[over at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept).
