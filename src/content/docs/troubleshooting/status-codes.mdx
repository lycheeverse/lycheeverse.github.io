title: Status Codes
description: Configure which HTTP status codes lychee should accept as valid responses.
---

Some websites return non-standard success codes instead of `200 OK`. Common alternatives include:

- `204` (No Content)
- `206` (Partial Content)
- `418` (I'm a teapot)
- Other [HTTP status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

## Accepting Additional Status Codes

Use `--accept` to specify which status codes should be treated as valid:

```bash
lychee --accept 200,204,206 .
```

This treats 200, 204, and 206 responses as successful.

## Common Use Cases

### API Endpoints

APIs often return `204 No Content` for successful operations without response bodies:

```bash
lychee --accept 200,201,204 .
```

### Partial Content

Media servers may return `206 Partial Content`:

```bash
lychee --accept 200,206 .
```

### Accept All 2xx Codes

Accept any successful 2xx status code:

```bash
lychee --accept '200..=299' .
```

## Configuration File

```toml title="lychee.toml"
accept = [200, 204, 206]
```

Or use ranges:

```toml title="lychee.toml"
accept = ['200..=299']
```

:::caution
Be cautious when accepting non-standard status codes. Verify the server's behavior to ensure the responses are actually valid.
