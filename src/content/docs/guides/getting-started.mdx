## Pre-built binaries

lychee provides binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows for every release.
You can download them from the [releases page](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee/releases).

## Docker

lychee provides a handy official image over at [lycheeverse/lychee](https://hub.docker.com/r/lycheeverse/lychee),
which is updated on every release.

To check files on your local machine, you need to mount them into the Docker
container.

Here's how to do that:

```bash
docker run --init -it -v `pwd`:/input lycheeverse/lychee /input/README.md
```

The `--init` parameter is passed so that lychee can be stopped
from the terminal. We also pass `-it` to start an interactive terminal, which
is required to show the progress bar.

## Cargo

### Build dependencies

On APT/dpkg-based Linux distros (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and Kali Linux) the following commands will install all required build dependencies, including the Rust toolchain and `cargo`:

```sh
curl -sSf '<https://sh.rustup.rs>' | sh
apt install gcc pkg-config libc6-dev libssl-dev
```

### Compile and install lychee

```sh
cargo install lychee
```

### Feature flags

lychee supports several feature flags:

- `native-tls` enables the platform-native TLS crate [native-tls](https://crates.io/crates/native-tls).
- `vendored-openssl` compiles and statically links a copy of OpenSSL. See the corresponding feature of the [openssl](https://crates.io/crates/openssl) crate.
- `rustls-tls` enables the alternative TLS crate [rustls](https://crates.io/crates/rustls).
- `email-check` enables checking email addresses using the [check-if-email-exists](https://crates.io/crates/check-if-email-exists) crate. This feature requires the native-tls feature.
- `check_example_domains` allows checking example domains such as `example.com.` This feature is useful for testing.

By default, `native-tls` and `email-check` are enabled.

## Usage

Lets get a quick overview of how to use lychee in your project.

### Check All Links In Current Directory

The following command _recursively_ checks all links in all supported files
inside the current directory.

```bash
lychee .
```

This traverses all subdirectories and checks the links in all files which lychee
supports, such as `.md`, `.html`, and more.

### Check All Links On A Website

```bash
lychee https://example.com
```

This command checks all links on the website `https://example.com`.
It is not recursive and only checks the links on the given page.
Recursion is currently not supported. You can however download the
sitemap of a website and use that as input.

### Check Only Specific Files

```bash
lychee README.md
lychee test.html info.txt
lychee test.html info.txt https://example.com
```

This command checks only the links in the given files.
It also demonstrates how to check multiple inputs, such as files and URLs
in a single command.

### Check Links In Directories, But Block All Network Requests

```bash
lychee --offline path/to/directory
```

This will only check the links in the files in the given directory and not make
any network requests. It is helpful for a quick local "linting" of files.

### Check Links In A Remote File

```bash
lychee https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lycheeverse/lychee/master/README.md
```

If a URL is given as input and it ends with a file extension other than `.html`,
lychee respects the file extension and interprets the file accordingly.
Here, we interpret the file as Markdown.

### Check links from `stdin`

```bash
cat test.md | lychee -
echo 'https://example.com' | lychee -
```

You don't need to put links into a file first. You can also pipe them into lychee
directly.

### Check Links In Local Files Via Shell Glob

```bash
lychee 'public/**/*.html'
```

Have many files in the same directory structure you want to check?
You don't need to list them all. Just use a shell glob!

The above command checks all `.html` files in the `public` directory and its
subdirectories.

:::note[Glob Expansion Rules]
Note that we use single quotes to prevent the shell from expanding the input
before lychee can process it.
:::

### Advanced Globbing And `~` Expansion

```bash
lychee '~/projects/big_project/\*_/README._'
```

This command checks all `README` files inside the `big_project` directory with
files ending in any file extension.
The `~` gets expanded to your home directory.

### Ignore Case When Globbing And Check Result For Each Link

```bash
lychee --glob-ignore-case --verbose '~/projects/\*_/[r]eadme._'
```

In this command, we ignore the case when globbing, so it matches

- `~/projects/my_project_/readme.md`
- `~/projects/cool_app_/README.txt`
- `~/projects/website_/readme.rst`
- `~/projects/rust_game_/README`
- `~/projects/python_script_/Readme.markdown`

### Check other file formats

By preprocessing files it is possible to do link checking on
files which aren't officially supported by lychee.
See [file preprocessing](/guides/preprocessing).
