lychee supports a lot of command line options.
You can see all of them by running `lychee --help`.

Below is the full list of options with a short description.

## Options

```text
A fast, async link checker

Finds broken URLs and mail addresses inside Markdown, HTML, `reStructuredText`, websites and more!

Usage: lychee [OPTIONS] [inputs]...

Arguments:
  [inputs]...
          The inputs (where to get links to check from). These can be: files (e.g. `README.md`), file globs (e.g. `"~/git/*/README.md"`), remote URLs (e.g. `https://example.com/README.md`) or standard input (`-`). Alternatively, use `--files-from` to read inputs from a file. NOTE: Use `--` to separate inputs from options that allow multiple arguments

Options:
      --files-from <PATH>
          Read input filenames from the given file or stdin (if path is '-').

          This is useful when you have a large number of inputs that would be
          cumbersome to specify on the command line directly.

          Examples:
            lychee --files-from list.txt
            find . -name '*.md' | lychee --files-from -
            echo 'README.md' | lychee --files-from -

          File Format:
            Each line should contain one input (file path, URL, or glob pattern).
            Lines starting with '#' are treated as comments and ignored.
            Empty lines are also ignored.

  -c, --config <CONFIG_FILE>
          Configuration file to use

          [default: lychee.toml]

  -v, --verbose...
          Set verbosity level; more output per occurrence (e.g. `-v` or `-vv`)

  -q, --quiet...
          Less output per occurrence (e.g. `-q` or `-qq`)

  -n, --no-progress
          Do not show progress bar.
          This is recommended for non-interactive shells (e.g. for continuous integration)

      --extensions <EXTENSIONS>
          Test the specified file extensions for URIs when checking files locally.

          Multiple extensions can be separated by commas. Note that if you want to check filetypes,
          which have multiple extensions, e.g. HTML files with both .html and .htm extensions, you need to
          specify both extensions explicitly.

          [default: md,mkd,mdx,mdown,mdwn,mkdn,mkdown,markdown,html,htm,txt]

      --cache
          Use request cache stored on disk at `.lycheecache`

      --max-cache-age <MAX_CACHE_AGE>
          Discard all cached requests older than this duration

          [default: 1d]

      --cache-exclude-status <CACHE_EXCLUDE_STATUS>
          A list of status codes that will be ignored from the cache

          The following exclude range syntax is supported: [start]..[[=]end]|code. Some valid
          examples are:

          - 429 (excludes the 429 status code only)
          - 500.. (excludes any status code >= 500)
          - ..100 (excludes any status code < 100)
          - 500..=599 (excludes any status code from 500 to 599 inclusive)
          - 500..600 (excludes any status code from 500 to 600 excluding 600, same as 500..=599)

          Use "lychee --cache-exclude-status '429, 500..502' <inputs>..." to provide a comma- separated
          list of excluded status codes. This example will not cache results with a status code of 429, 500
          and 501.

          [default: ]

      --dump
          Don't perform any link checking. Instead, dump all the links extracted from inputs that would be checked

      --dump-inputs
          Don't perform any link extraction and checking. Instead, dump all input sources from which links would be collected

      --archive <ARCHIVE>
          Specify the use of a specific web archive. Can be used in combination with `--suggest`

          [possible values: wayback]

      --suggest
          Suggest link replacements for broken links, using a web archive. The web archive can be specified with `--archive`

  -m, --max-redirects <MAX_REDIRECTS>
          Maximum number of allowed redirects

          [default: 5]

      --max-retries <MAX_RETRIES>
          Maximum number of retries per request

          [default: 3]

      --min-tls <MIN_TLS>
          Minimum accepted TLS Version

          [possible values: TLSv1_0, TLSv1_1, TLSv1_2, TLSv1_3]

      --max-concurrency <MAX_CONCURRENCY>
          Maximum number of concurrent network requests

          [default: 128]

  -T, --threads <THREADS>
          Number of threads to utilize. Defaults to number of cores available to the system

  -u, --user-agent <USER_AGENT>
          User agent

          [default: lychee/x.y.z]

  -i, --insecure
          Proceed for server connections considered insecure (invalid TLS)

  -s, --scheme <SCHEME>
          Only test links with the given schemes (e.g. https). Omit to check links with any other scheme. At the moment, we support http, https, file, and mailto

      --offline
          Only check local files and block network requests

      --include <INCLUDE>
          URLs to check (supports regex). Has preference over all excludes

      --exclude <EXCLUDE>
          Exclude URLs and mail addresses from checking. The values are treated as regular expressions

      --exclude-file <EXCLUDE_FILE>
          Deprecated; use `--exclude-path` instead

      --exclude-path <EXCLUDE_PATH>
          Exclude paths from getting checked. The values are treated as regular expressions

  -E, --exclude-all-private
          Exclude all private IPs from checking.
          Equivalent to `--exclude-private --exclude-link-local --exclude-loopback`

      --exclude-private
          Exclude private IP address ranges from checking

      --exclude-link-local
          Exclude link-local IP address range from checking

      --exclude-loopback
          Exclude loopback IP address range and localhost from checking

      --include-mail
          Also check email addresses

      --remap <REMAP>
          Remap URI matching pattern to different URI

      --fallback-extensions <FALLBACK_EXTENSIONS>
          When checking locally, attempts to locate missing files by trying the given
          fallback extensions. Multiple extensions can be separated by commas. Extensions
          will be checked in order of appearance.

          Example: --fallback-extensions html,htm,php,asp,aspx,jsp,cgi

          Note: This option takes effect on `file://` URIs which do not exist and on
                `file://` URIs pointing to directories which resolve to themself (by the
                --index-files logic).

      --index-files <INDEX_FILES>
          When checking locally, resolves directory links to a separate index file.
          The argument is a comma-separated list of index file names to search for. Index
          names are relative to the link's directory and attempted in the order given.

          If `--index-files` is specified, then at least one index file must exist in
          order for a directory link to be considered valid. Additionally, the special
          name `.` can be used in the list to refer to the directory itself.

          If unspecified (the default behavior), index files are disabled and directory
          links are considered valid as long as the directory exists on disk.

          Example 1: `--index-files index.html,readme.md` looks for index.html or readme.md
                     and requires that at least one exists.

          Example 2: `--index-files index.html,.` will use index.html if it exists, but
                     still accept the directory link regardless.

          Example 3: `--index-files ''` will reject all directory links because there are
                     no valid index files. This will require every link to explicitly name
                     a file.

          Note: This option only takes effect on `file://` URIs which exist and point to a directory.

  -H, --header <HEADER:VALUE>
          Set custom header for requests

          Some websites require custom headers to be passed in order to return valid responses.
          You can specify custom headers in the format 'Name: Value'. For example, 'Accept: text/html'.
          This is the same format that other tools like curl or wget use.
          Multiple headers can be specified by using the flag multiple times.

  -a, --accept <ACCEPT>
          A List of accepted status codes for valid links

          The following accept range syntax is supported: [start]..[[=]end]|code. Some valid
          examples are:

          - 200 (accepts the 200 status code only)
          - ..204 (accepts any status code < 204)
          - ..=204 (accepts any status code <= 204)
          - 200..=204 (accepts any status code from 200 to 204 inclusive)
          - 200..205 (accepts any status code from 200 to 205 excluding 205, same as 200..=204)

          Use "lychee --accept '200..=204, 429, 500' <inputs>..." to provide a comma-
          separated list of accepted status codes. This example will accept 200, 201,
          202, 203, 204, 429, and 500 as valid status codes.

          [default: 100..=103,200..=299]

      --include-fragments
          Enable the checking of fragments in links

  -t, --timeout <TIMEOUT>
          Website timeout in seconds from connect to response finished

          [default: 20]

  -r, --retry-wait-time <RETRY_WAIT_TIME>
          Minimum wait time in seconds between retries of failed requests

          [default: 1]

  -X, --method <METHOD>
          Request method

          [default: get]

      --base <BASE>
          Deprecated; use `--base-url` instead

  -b, --base-url <BASE_URL>
          Base URL to use when resolving relative URLs in local files. If specified,
          relative links in local files are interpreted as being relative to the given
          base URL.

          For example, given a base URL of `https://example.com/dir/page`, the link `a`
          would resolve to `https://example.com/dir/a` and the link `/b` would resolve
          to `https://example.com/b`. This behavior is not affected by the filesystem
          path of the file containing these links.

          Note that relative URLs without a leading slash become siblings of the base
          URL. If, instead, the base URL ended in a slash, the link would become a child
          of the base URL. For example, a base URL of `https://example.com/dir/page/` and
          a link of `a` would resolve to `https://example.com/dir/page/a`.

          Basically, the base URL option resolves links as if the local files were hosted
          at the given base URL address.

      --root-dir <ROOT_DIR>
          Root directory to use when checking absolute links in local files. This option is
          required if absolute links appear in local files, otherwise those links will be
          flagged as errors. This must be an absolute path (i.e., one beginning with `/`).

          If specified, absolute links in local files are resolved by prefixing the given
          root directory to the requested absolute link. For example, with a root-dir of
          `/root/dir`, a link to `/page.html` would be resolved to `/root/dir/page.html`.

          This option can be specified alongside `--base-url`. If both are given, an
          absolute link is resolved by constructing a URL from three parts: the domain
          name specified in `--base-url`, followed by the `--root-dir` directory path,
          followed by the absolute link's own path.

      --basic-auth <BASIC_AUTH>
          Basic authentication support. E.g. `http://example.com username:password`

      --github-token <GITHUB_TOKEN>
          GitHub API token to use when checking github.com links, to avoid rate limiting

          [env: GITHUB_TOKEN]

      --skip-missing
          Skip missing input files (default is to error if they don't exist)

      --no-ignore
          Do not skip files that would otherwise be ignored by '.gitignore', '.ignore', or the global ignore file

      --hidden
          Do not skip hidden directories and files

      --include-verbatim
          Find links in verbatim sections like `pre`- and `code` blocks

      --glob-ignore-case
          Ignore case when expanding filesystem path glob inputs

  -o, --output <OUTPUT>
          Output file of status report

      --mode <MODE>
          Set the output display mode. Determines how results are presented in the terminal

          [default: color]
          [possible values: plain, color, emoji, task]

  -f, --format <FORMAT>
          Output format of final status report

          [default: compact]
          [possible values: compact, detailed, json, markdown, raw]

      --require-https
          When HTTPS is available, treat HTTP links as errors

      --cookie-jar <COOKIE_JAR>
          Tell lychee to read cookies from the given file. Cookies will be stored in the cookie jar and sent with requests. New cookies will be stored in the cookie jar and existing cookies will be updated

      --include-wikilinks
          Check WikiLinks in Markdown files

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
```

:::note
Most of the options (like `--scheme` or `--exclude`) are for **links inside inputs**,
and **not** for the filtering the inputs themselves.
:::

## On Schemes

lychee supports the following schemes:

- `http`
- `https`
- `file`
- `mailto`

If you don't specify any schemes, lychee will check all links regardless of
their scheme. Otherwise, it will only check links with the specified schemes.

## Repeating Options

Options marked with `...` can be specified multiple times.
For example, `--exclude` can be specified multiple times to exclude multiple URLs.
This is also true for `--header`, `--include`, `--remap`, `--scheme`, and `--exclude-path`.

Here is an example:

```bash
lychee --exclude https://example.com --exclude https://example.org
```

There is a shorthand where you can specify multiple arguments in one go.

Instead of writing this:

```bash
lychee --scheme http --scheme file https://example.com
```

You can also write this:

```bash
lychee --scheme http file -- https://example.com
```

:::caution[Attention]
If you use the shorthand notation you need to separate the options from the inputs with `--`.
Otherwise, the options will be interpreted as inputs!
