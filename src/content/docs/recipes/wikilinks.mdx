description: Check Wikilinks in Markdown files that include full paths to linked resources.
---

lychee can check Wikilinks in Markdown files if they include a path to the linked resource.

## Supported Format

```markdown
# ✅ Works - includes path

[[https://example.com/docs/]]
[[./another/markdown/file.md]]

# ❌ Doesn't work - path-less links

[[another-markdown-page]]
```

## Limitations

Tools like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) use path-less Wikilinks with just the filename (no path or extension).

lychee cannot determine the correct path for these links because the file could be:
- In the same directory
- In a subdirectory
- In a parent directory

Recursive search for these files is not currently supported.
