title: Local File Checking with --root-dir
description: Understanding how to use lychee's --root-dir parameter for local file checking
---

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
export const fileName = "index.html";
export const fileLang = "html";

## What Does --root-dir Do?

The `--root-dir` parameter tells lychee where to look for files that start with `/`. Let's see an example:

<Code
  code={`<!-- index.html -->
<a href="/about.html">About</a>
<a href="/docs/guide.html">Guide</a>`}
  lang={fileLang}
  title={fileName}
/>

These links start with `/`, meaning they're absolute paths.

If the site is built in a `public` directory, the files will be in `public/about.html` and `public/docs/guide.html`. To check these links, you'd run:

```bash
lychee --root-dir "$(pwd)/public" "**/*.html"
```

lychee will look for:

- `./public/about.html`
- `./public/docs/guide.html`

## When Do You Need --root-dir?

You need `--root-dir` when:

1. Your HTML contains links starting with `/`
2. You want to check these links against files on your computer

Common scenarios:

- Static site builds in a `public` or `dist` directory
- Documentation sites with absolute links
- Any project where links start with `/`

:::note
`--root-dir` must be an absolute path. If you provide a relative path, lychee will error.

```bash
# ✅ Good
lychee --root-dir /home/user/project/public/

# ❌ Bad: will fail
lychee --root-dir ./public/
```

This is a conservative solution to prevent edge cases.

## Examples

### Static Site Builder

If you use Hugo, Jekyll, or similar tools, they often generate sites in a `public` directory:

```bash
my-site/
├── public/           # Generated files live here
│   ├── about.html
│   └── docs/
│       └── guide.html
└── content/          # Source files
    └── index.md
```

To check the links:

```bash
# Convert relative path to absolute first
lychee --root-dir "$(pwd)/public" "public/**/*.html"
```

### Documentation Site

Many documentation sites use absolute paths for links:

<Code
  code={`<!-- docs/index.html -->
<a href="/api/v1.html">API</a>
<a href="/guide/start.html">Get Started</a>`}
  lang={fileLang}
  title="docs/index.html"
/>

To check these links:

```bash
# Assuming you're in the project root
lychee --root-dir "$(pwd)" "docs/**/*.html"
```

## The Difference Between --root-dir and --base-url

These parameters serve different purposes:

- `--root-dir` is for finding files on your computer

  - Only affects links that start with `/`
  - Must be an absolute filesystem path
  - Used when checking local files

- [`--base-url`](base-url) is for resolving URLs
  - Must be a URL (like `https://example.com/docs/`)
  - Used when checking how links will work once deployed
  - Affects relative links (like `./guide.html`)

### Using Both Together

Sometimes you need both:

```bash
lychee \
  --root-dir "$(pwd)/public" \
  --base-url https://example.com/ \
  "public/**/*.html"
```

This tells lychee:

1. Look for `/`-prefixed files in `./public/`
2. Resolve relative links against `https://example.com/`

## Troubleshooting

If your links aren't being found:

1. Make sure you're using an absolute path:

```bash
# Get absolute path in bash
full_path="$(pwd)/public"
lychee --root-dir "$full_path" "**/*.html"
```

2. Check that the files exist in the location you expect:

```bash
# Example debugging steps
ls -la ./public/about.html
ls -la ./public/docs/guide.html
```

3. Use `--verbose` to see how lychee is resolving paths:

```bash
lychee --root-dir "$(pwd)/public" --verbose "**/*.html"
```
