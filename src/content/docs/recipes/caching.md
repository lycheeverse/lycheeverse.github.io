title: Caching
description: Speed up repeated link checks by caching results between runs to reduce redundant network requests.

Caching can significantly speed up repeated checks by reducing requests to the same URL during consecutive runs. For instance, caching responses from `https://github.com` can decrease the load when checking multiple links. Here's how to cache the results of a Lychee run.

## Caching on the command line

To cache the results of a lychee run, you can use the `--cache` flag. This
will save the results to a `.lycheecache` file in the current directory. The
next time you run lychee with the `--cache` flag, it will use the cached
results instead of making a new request.

```bash
lychee --cache --verbose --no-progress './**/*.md' './**/*.html'
```

:::tip
Check out the `.lycheecache` file to see the cached results.
It's just a plaintext file with the URLs and their status codes
as well as a UNIX timestamp per entry, which is used to determine
the cache's age.

The great thing is, that you can remove single lines from the cache
file to re-check the URLs on the next run. It's human-readable and
editable.

## Caching in Docker

If you're running lychee inside a Docker container, caching is still possible,
but a little trickier.

You need to create a volume to cache the results. This way, the results will persist between runs.

:::warning
You need to create the `.lycheecache` file in the current directory before
running the Docker container.
:::

```bash
touch .lycheecache
docker run -it -v $(pwd)/.lycheecache:/.lycheecache lycheeverse/lychee --cache --verbose https://lychee.cli.rs
```

## Caching in GitHub Actions
