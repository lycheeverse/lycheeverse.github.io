## What Is The Base URL?

The `--base-url` parameter in lychee lets you check links for sites that aren't
served from the root domain. This is useful when your site lives in a
subdirectory, like `example.com/docs/`.

## Do You Need To Set A Base URL?

Most of the time, you don't! Skip `--base-url` if:

- Your site runs at a root domain (like `example.com`)
- You're only checking absolute URLs
- Your links should resolve relative to their files

You need `--base-url` when your site lives in a subdirectory.

Let's look at an example:

<Code
  code={`<a href="./getting-started.html">Get Started</a>
<a href="../about.html">About Us</a>`}
  lang={fileLang}
  title={fileName}
/>

Say this page will be deployed to `example.com/docs/guide.html`. Those relative links should resolve to:

- `example.com/docs/getting-started.html`
- `example.com/about.html`

To check if these links are valid, tell lychee where the site will be hosted:

```bash
lychee --base-url https://example.com/docs/ "**/*.html"
```

:::note[Good to know]
The `--base-url` parameter works similarly to other tools you might know:

- [Jekyll's `baseurl`](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/)
- [Vite's `base` config](https://vike.dev/base-url#base)
- [Hugo's `baseURL`](https://gohugo.io/methods/site/baseurl/)
- [The HTML `<base>` tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_base.asp)

If you've used any of these, lychee's `--base-url` follows the same concept.

## How Does It Work?

When you set `--base-url`, lychee will:

1. Find all links in your HTML files
2. Convert relative links to full URLs
3. Check if the referenced files exist in your project

Here's what happens to different types of links:

<Code
  code={`<!-- Original links -->
<a href="./guide.html">Guide</a>
<a href="../about.html">About</a>
<a href="https://other.com">External</a>

<!-- After --base-url https://example.com/docs/ -->

<a href="https://example.com/docs/guide.html">Guide</a>
<a href="https://example.com/about.html">About</a>
<a href="https://other.com">External</a>`} lang={fileLang}

## Common Use Cases

### Documentation Sites

Running your docs locally? Tell lychee to check against your dev server:

```bash
lychee --base-url http://localhost:3000/docs/ "docs/**/*.html"
```

Want to verify links before deploying? lychee can check if files exist in your project:

```bash
lychee --base-url https://example.com/docs/ "docs/**/*.html"
```

:::note
Even though your site isn't deployed yet, lychee can verify that the files your links point to exist in your project. This helps catch broken links before they go live!

### GitHub Pages

If your site will be on GitHub Pages:

```bash
# For a project site
lychee --base-url https://username.github.io/project/ "**/*.html"

# For local development
lychee --base-url http://localhost:4000/project/ "**/*.html"
```

### Blogging Platforms

Using WordPress, Ghost, or Jekyll with a blog at `example.com/blog/`? Here's how to check those links:

```bash
lychee --base-url https://example.com/blog/ "content/**/*.html"
```

## Local Development

You can use `file://` URLs to check files without running a server:

```bash
lychee --base-url file:///absolute/path/to/site/ "**/*.html"
```

This is helpful when you want to verify links exist on your filesystem.

## Important Details

Let me explain the technical necessity of the trailing slash:

### Add A Trailing Slash If It's A Directory

When in doubt about whether to include the trailing slash, include it. It's almost always what you want when working with static sites and documentation.

<Code
  code={`# ✅ Good - links will resolve correctly
lychee --base-url https://example.com/docs/
# ❌ Bad - links will break
lychee --base-url https://example.com/docs`}
  lang="bash"
  title="Trailing Slash Example"
/>

The trailing slash is crucial because it tells lychee whether `/docs` is a file or a directory. This follows standard URL resolution rules:

- `https://example.com/docs/` (with slash) means "docs" is a directory

  - `./guide.html` resolves to `/docs/guide.html`
  - `../about.html` resolves to `/about.html`

- `https://example.com/docs` (no slash) means "docs" could be a file
  - `./guide.html` resolves to `/guide.html` (goes up one level!)
  - `../about.html` resolves to `/about.html`

lychee can't automatically add the slash because both forms are valid - they just mean different things. For example, `https://example.com/docs` might be a single page, while `https://example.com/docs/` is its directory version. This distinction is part of how URLs work on the web.

## `--base-url` vs `--root-dir`

These solve different problems:

- `--base-url` is for URLs (like `https://example.com/docs/`)

  - Use it when you care about your site's final URL structure
  - Helps validate relative links

- [`--root-dir`](/recipes/root-dir) is for file paths (like `./public/`)
  - Use it to find files on your computer
  - Helps validate absolute paths

You can use both together:

```bash
lychee --base-url https://example.com/docs/ --root-dir $(pwd)/public/ "public/**/*.html"
```

## Troubleshooting

If links aren't being checked correctly:

1. Verify your base URL has a trailing slash
2. For local development, ensure your server is running
3. Use `--verbose` to see how lychee resolves links
