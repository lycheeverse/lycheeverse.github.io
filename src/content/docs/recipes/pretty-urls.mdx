title: Pretty URLs (Fallback Extensions and Index Files)
description: Handle pretty URLs that omit file extensions or index filenames when checking local files.
lychee---

Pretty URLs omit file extensions or index filenames to make links shorter. lychee supports checking these URLs in local files.

:::note
Pretty URLs only need special handling for local files. When checking online webpages, the web server resolves them automatically.
:::

lychee## Fallback Extensions

Static site generators like Hugo can generate URLs without `.html` extensions. lychee can try multiple extensions when a link doesn't resolve:

```bash
lychee --fallback-extensions html,htm docs/
```

If a link like `/about` doesn't exist, lychee will try:
1. `/about.html`
2. `/about.htm`

## Index Files

Many web servers return an index file (like `index.html`) when a directory is requested.

By default, lychee considers directory links valid if the directory exists. To check for index files:

```bash
lychee --index-files index.html,index.htm docs/
```

lychee will look for these files in the specified order. If none exist, the link is broken.

### Accept Directories as Fallback

Use `.` to accept directories if no index file is found:

```bash
lychee --index-files index.html,. docs/
```

This checks for `index.html` first, then accepts the directory if it exists.

## Combined Usage

```bash
lychee --fallback-extensions html --index-files index.html,. docs/
```

:::tip
Fallback extensions are not applied to index file names. Specify full filenames in `--index-files`.

## Configuration File

```toml title="lychee.toml"
fallback_extensions = ["html", "htm"]
# Note: index_files not yet supported in config
```
