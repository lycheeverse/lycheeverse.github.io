lychee would not be possible without the following projects.
**Thanks a lot to all maintainers and contributors.**

- [peter-evans/link-checker](https://github.com/peter-evans/link-checker): A GitHub action for link checking repository Markdown and HTML files. It served as the original template for lychee-action.
- [raphlinus/pulldown-cmark](https://github.com/raphlinus/pulldown-cmark): A pull parser for CommonMark, written in Rust. It comes with a simple command-line tool, useful for rendering to HTML, and is also designed to be easy to use from as a library.
- [reacherhq/check-if-mail-exists](https://github.com/reacherhq/check-if-email-exists): Check if an email address exists without sending any email.
- [robinst/linkify](https://github.com/robinst/linkify): Rust library to find links such as URLs and email addresses in plain text, handling surrounding punctuation correctly.
- [untitaker/html5gum](https://github.com/untitaker/html5gum): A WHATWG-compliant HTML5 tokenizer and tag soup parser
