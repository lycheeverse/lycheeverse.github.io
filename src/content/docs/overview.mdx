## What is lychee?

lychee is a fast, async link checker written in Rust. It finds broken hyperlinks and mail addresses in your Markdown and HTML files, codebases, and websites. It's simple, lightweight, and easy to use.
It is perfect for checking documentation, blogs, and static sites, and can be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

## Why was lychee created?

lychee was born out of a personal need. Matthias, the original author, maintains
a [repository for static code analysis tools on Github](https://github.com/analysis-tools-dev/static-analysis). The links to the
tools regularly broke, so he decided to add a link checker to the repo, to get
notified. Unfortunately the existing solutions were either too slow, deprecated,
or were lacking functionality. So he decided to write a link checker himself
&mdash; how hard could it be?

A few _years_ later, he reached a point where 10% of the functionality works
most of the time and the result is called lychee.

## Trivia

### Project Name

The name lychee is a play on _link checker_. Originally we wanted to call it
[liche](https://github.com/raviqqe/liche), but that name was already used by a
link checker written in Go (which has since been deprecated).

### Original Motivation

Matthias live-coded the first version of lychee in an episode of Hello Rust.
You can watch it below.
