## What is lychee?

lychee is a fast, async link checker written in Rust. It finds broken hyperlinks and mail addresses in Markdown files, HTML documents, codebases, and websites.

## Why lychee?

- **Fast**: Asynchronous architecture checks thousands of links concurrently
- **Reliable**: Handles real-world HTML, Markdown, and plaintext files
- **Lightweight**: Single static binary with no runtime dependencies
- **Flexible**: Extensive configuration options and multiple output formats
- **CI/CD Ready**: JSON output and GitHub Action support
- **Open Source**: Actively maintained with community contributions

## Origin Story

lychee was created by Matthias Endler to solve a specific problem: broken links in the [static analysis tools repository](https://github.com/analysis-tools-dev/static-analysis). Existing link checkers were either too slow, deprecated, or lacked necessary features.

What started as a simple solution evolved into a robust, production-ready tool used by major projects across GitHub.

## Project Name

The name "lychee" is a play on _link checker_. The original name [liche](https://github.com/raviqqe/liche) was already taken by a Go-based link checker (now deprecated).

## First Version

Matthias live-coded the first version of lychee in an episode of Hello Rust:

<div style=" position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 40px;">

## Key Features

### Speed
Built with Rust and designed for performance. Async architecture enables checking large projects in seconds.

### Native Format Support
Dedicated parsers for Markdown and HTML. Fallback parser for plaintext and unknown formats.

### Static Binary
Distributed as a single executable. No runtime dependencies or complex installation.

### Structured Output
JSON output for easy integration with CI/CD pipelines and automation tools.

### Highly Configurable
Extensive options for exclusions, retries, timeouts, rate limiting, caching, and custom headers.

### Community Driven
Open source with active development. Contributions welcome from developers worldwide.
