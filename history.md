# History

lychee was born out of a personal need. Matthias, the original author, maintains
a [repository for static code analysis tools on
Github](https://github.com/analysis-tools-dev/static-analysis). The links to the
tools regularly broke, so he decided to add a link checker to the repo, to get
notified. Unfortunately the existing solutions were either too slow, deprecated,
or were lacking functionality. So he decided to write a link checker himself
&mdash; how hard could it be?

A few _years_ later, he reached a point where 10% of the functionality works
most of the time and the result is called lychee.

## Trivia


### Project Name

The name lychee is a play on *link checker*. Originally we wanted to call it
[liche](https://github.com/raviqqe/liche), but that name was already used by a
link checker written in Go (which has since been deprecated).

### Original Motivation

Matthias live-coded the first version of lychee in an episode of [Hello Rust][hello-rust].
